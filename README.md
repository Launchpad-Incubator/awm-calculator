# Calculator

## Description

A calculator made by Aidan McMillan (@arduinohatesme, @launchpadinc-ai) in python as an example for python coding.

## Planned Updates

Starting from v7, the Formatting-Module will be added for more clarity and readability.
Next function will be simple algebra. (a + bx = c).
Updating the Github with better version control, while keeping older versions around is also planned. (Specifically v5, because it's a simpler example without formatting or classes.)

### Current version: 6.1.7
