# Calculator

A python calculator made by Aidan McMillan (@arduinohatesme, @launchpadinc-ai) as an example for python coding at Launchpad. Last updated 7/23/2025.

## How To Use 🤔

1. Download `awm-calculator-final.py` and `awmformat.py`
2. Install python 3 if you haven`t already.
3. Navigate to the downloads directory in Terminal.
4. Type `python awm-calculator-final.py` in Terminal
5. Finish your math homework!

## Planned Updates 🧠

- Updating algebra and adding linear equation solver
- Updating all code for easier reading and debugging

## Function Guide 🖥️

`import`       -> Imports a module. Modules add extra functions with new functionality to python. \
`operation`    -> This is an example of a variable. This value can be changed throughout the code to allow for more complex code. \
`[0, 0]`       -> This is an example of a list. Lists store multiple values and are dynamic like variables. \
`True`         -> This is an example of a boolean. Booleans can be either `True` or `False` and are used for logic operations like `and`, `or`, and `not`. \
`def`          -> This is a function defenition, and allows you to run a block of code whenever the function is called. \
`class`        -> Classes are objects with functions inside them that all have a set of shared properties. They are usually used to control multiple objects. \
`(first_time)` -> This is an example of an argument. Arguments are values passed into a function that the function uses in its logic. \
`return`       -> Returns mean that functions can be treated like variables, being equal to the returned value. They are often used in debugging code. \
`if`           -> Runs the indented code inside if the statement is `True`. \
`input`        -> Built-in function that `returns` the user input in the terminal.
