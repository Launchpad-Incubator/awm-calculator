# Calculator

## Description

A calculator made by Aidan McMillan (@arduinohatesme, @launchpadinc-ai) in python as an example for python coding.

## Planned Updates

Next function will be simple algebra. (a + bx = c).
Updating the Github with better version control, while keeping older versions around is also planned. (Specifically v5, because it's a simpler example without formatting or classes.)
Updated UI for easier operation.

## Function Guide

'import'       -> Imports a module. Modules add extra functions with new functionality to python. \n
'operation'    -> This is an example of a variable. This value can be changed throughout the code to allow for more complex code. \n
'[0, 0]'       -> This is an example of a list. Lists store multiple values and are dynamic like variables. \n
'True'         -> This is an example of a boolean. Booleans can be either 'True' or 'False' and are used for logic operations like 'AND', 'OR', and 'NOT'. \n
'def'          -> This is a function defenition, and allows you to run a block of code whenever the function is called. \n
'class'        -> Classes are objects with functions inside them that all have a set of shared properties. \n
'(first_time)' -> This is an example of an argument. Arguments are values passed into a function that the function uses in its logic. \n
'return'       -> Returns mean that functions can be treated like variables, being equal to the returned value. They are often used in debugging code. \n
'if'           -> Runs the indented code inside if the statement is 'True'.
'match'        -> Takes in one argument and matches it to each 'case'. Runs the code inside if they match. 'case _:' is a fallback case that runs if nothing else before it did. \n
'input'        -> Built-in function that 'returns' the user input in the terminal.

### Current version: FINAL

All updates will be made to this same file. This will be the end of the version folders.
