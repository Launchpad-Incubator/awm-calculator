# Calculator

A python calculator made by Aidan McMillan (@arduinohatesme, @launchpadinc-ai) as an example for python coding at Launchpad. Last updated 7/23/2025.

## How To Use 🤔

1. Download 'awm-calculator-final.py' and 'awmformat.py'
2. Install python 3 if you haven't already.
3. Navigate to the downloads directory in Terminal.
4. Type 'python awm-calculator-final.py'
5. Finish your math homework!

## Planned Updates 🧠

- Next function will be simple algebra (a + bx = c).
- Updating the Github with better version control, while keeping older versions around is also planned. (Specifically v5, because it`s a simpler example without formatting or classes.)
- Visual-based UI

## Function Guide 🖥️

`import`       -> Imports a module. Modules add extra functions with new functionality to python. \
`operation`    -> This is an example of a variable. This value can be changed throughout the code to allow for more complex code. \
`[0, 0]`       -> This is an example of a list. Lists store multiple values and are dynamic like variables. \
`True`         -> This is an example of a boolean. Booleans can be either `True` or `False` and are used for logic operations like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. \
`def`          -> This is a function defenition, and allows you to run a block of code whenever the function is called. \
`class`        -> Classes are objects with functions inside them that all have a set of shared properties. \
`(first_time)` -> This is an example of an argument. Arguments are values passed into a function that the function uses in its logic. \
`return`       -> Returns mean that functions can be treated like variables, being equal to the returned value. They are often used in debugging code. \
`if`           -> Runs the indented code inside if the statement is `True`. \
`match`        -> Takes in one argument and matches it to each `case`. Runs the code inside if they match. `case _:` is a fallback case that runs if nothing else before it did. \
`input`        -> Built-in function that `returns` the user input in the terminal.

### Current version: FINAL

All updates will be made to awm-calculator-final. This will be the end of the version folders. Versions can be found at the docstring at the top.
